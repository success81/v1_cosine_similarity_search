Business Process Improvement
DuraBante uses Lean Six Sigma and Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) methodologies to 
improve and redesign processes to make them faster, better, and cheaper. We go one 
step beyond the traditional Six Sigma techniques by developing procedures, reference 
guides, and training to successfully control the improved processes and make them 
sustainable.
Training, Mentoring, and Coaching
DuraBante’s Training Program is designed to meet the needs of today’s businesses with core 
offerings centered around communication, project management, and Lean Six Sigma. Our 
field experience keeps training relevant, understandable, and applicable. Lessons learned 
can be applied immediately and successfully in the workplace. One-on-one mentoring is 
available as part of the training program, as well as a separate class for those that want to

Procedure Program Development
DuraBante’s professional program and procedure management team develops  “Human 
Factored”  procedures and implements quality programs using Procedure Professional 
Association guidelines. With the increased need to prove compliance and safety, 
standardization and procedures are crucial. Incorporating  “Human Performance Tools”  
such as  “Peer Checking”  and  “Three-Way Communication”  with procedures that have 
been  “Human Factored”  for clarity greatly mitigates the potential for errors and injuries.
